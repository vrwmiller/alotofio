<p align="left"><font size="3">Record/Jacket. A (+) or (-) following a grade is an indication of the more (-) or less (+) imperfections on a particular item.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>SEALED (SS): </b></font><font size="3">You can be assured that the vinyl is as it was&nbsp;
manufactured and has never been played. The cover may have slight corner ‘dings’ or possibly a cutout mark (cutout marks&nbsp;
will ALWAYS be photographed and described). If we think that the cover of a sealed LP shows more than a small amount of wear we will describe the&nbsp;
condition with two grades such as SS/VG+ where the second grade indicates the condition of the sealed cover.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>MINT (M):</b></font><font size="3"><b> </b>Mint means absolutely perfect. Nothing less can&nbsp;
be described as mint. Even brand new purchases may not qualify as mint. We, personally, do not believe ANYTHING is perfect so the&nbsp;
highest rating we give is <b>Near Mint</b>.&nbsp; Anyone can pick up a new item and find some kind of imperfection.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>NEAR MINT (NM):</b></font><font size="3"><b> </b>It should look like it was just purchased and sound the same.&nbsp;
Common imperfections found on items we grade as near mint would be very minor corner dings on the cover or vinyl imperfections caused during the manufacturing process that <b>DO NOT</b> affect play.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>VERY GOOD (VG):</b></font><font size="3"><b> </b>As Rockin’ Records puts it –&nbsp;
"Records in <i>very good </i>condition should have a minimum of visual or audible imperfections, which should not detract much&nbsp;
from your enjoyment of owning them". Imperfections that may result in a VG rating include: Slight wear ring, possibly&nbsp;
evidence of a removed (or still attached) sticker, minor writing on the cover, very small seam split (less than 1 inch?). The&nbsp;
vinyl may have visual marks such as paper scuffs, fingernail marks, slight stacking/sliding scratches caused by records&nbsp;
rubbing together. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>NOTE</b></font><font size="3"><b>:</b> Any record that has a scratch that can be felt&nbsp;
with the edge of your little finger and can be heard as a constant ‘POP’ every time it is encountered, is </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>NOT</b></font><font size="3"> a VG record. Slight background static/hiss/clicks may be heard on a VG record.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>GOOD (G):</b></font><font size="3"><b> </b>A record described as in Good condition will&nbsp;
show definite signs of wear and tear, indicating that it was not properly taken care of by its former owner. Even so, records in&nbsp;
good condition should play <b>all </b>the way through without skipping. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b>IF A RECORD&nbsp;
SKIPS, IT IS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION</b></font><font size="3">. Constant background static/hiss/clicks may be heard on a G record&nbsp;
but it won’t over power the music. The cover should be complete but there will be seam splits, distracting marks/writing, and/or stickers.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>FAIR (F):</b></font><font size="3"><b> </b>A record described as in Fair condition will&nbsp;
show definite signs of abuse, indicating that it was abused by its former owner. Records in fair condition may occasionally skip&nbsp;
when played. Frequent over powering background static/hiss/clicks/pops will be heard on an F record. It may also&nbsp;
have scratches that can be felt with the edge of your little finger and can be heard as a constant ‘POP’ every time&nbsp;
it is encountered. It really should not be played as it will damage the stylus. The cover may not be complete and there will&nbsp;
be large seam splits, very distracting marks/writing, and/or stickers.</font></p>


<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>POOR (P):</b></font><font size="3"><b> </b>A record described as in Poor condition should have the vinyl&nbsp;
cut from around the label and the label used as a coaster. The cover can’t hold the record any more because it is totally split apart or missing pieces.</font></p>

<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">In short, a cutout is a 'discontinued item'.&nbsp; It is a way for the manufacturer/distributor to know&nbsp;
that they have chosen to no longer keep it in stock and it was sold to the distributor at a discounted price.&nbsp; </font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">Records, CDs, &amp; Tapes that stores don't sell, can be sent back to the distributors for a full credit.&nbsp;
In that way, the stores can afford to stock items that they are not sure if they will sell or not.&nbsp; When the manufacturer/distributor decides that they&nbsp;
are no longer going to carry a particular item in their stock, they mark all of their current stock of that item in a way that involves cutting part&nbsp;
of the cover and then they sell it all to "cutout distributors" with the understanding that these items are not returnable for full credit.</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">When retail stores return their stock that didn't sell, the distributor can then check to see if any of&nbsp;
the items are 'marked' (cutouts).&nbsp; If they are marked, the distributors know this was a discounted item and are not obligated to give credit to the store for the return.</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">The same type of thing is done in the book trade.&nbsp; If you were to go into a discount book store, you&nbsp;
may note that many of the books are 'marked'.&nbsp; Most will have a black mark placed on the edges of the books.&nbsp; Some of&nbsp;
them (usually the paperbacks) will have a corner of the cover or dust jacket cut off (just like a record).</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">The misconception with a cutout is that many people think that it means they are "seconds/defects".&nbsp; That is&nbsp;
not the case.&nbsp; Cutouts are NOT defective returns. They are overstocks. The 'mark' is intended to identify an item so that&nbsp;
the distributors who purchased it, cannot buy an overstock item and then return it at a later time to the record company for a 'full refund'. </font></p>


<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><strong>THE CUTOUT MARK DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THESE ITEMS WERE DEFECTIVE IN ANY WAY.</strong></font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">The type of 'mark' varies among the different companies. On 45s, a full case of 45s is put on a drill&nbsp;
press and a hole is drilled through the box - passing through the label, vinyl, and any picture sleeve that happened to be there -&nbsp;
this type of mark is referred to as a 'Drill Hole - DH'. This has a MAJOR drawback in that if too much pressure is used on the&nbsp;
drill press, it will crack the vinyl. This practice was also used for a short time on LPs but not by many companies - Phillips/Mercury/Smash comes to mind.</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">On LPs, there are several methods used - all involved marking the cover in any number of ways. (sometimes more than one)</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">1. Drill press as above but only through the corner of the jacket. (Drill hole - DH)<br>
2. Power saw that cuts a slit into the jacket edge - but missing the record! (saw mark - SM)<br>
3. Power saw/Paper cutter that cuts off a corner of the jacket. (cut corner - CC)<br>
4. Punch that punches out a hole in the corner of the jacket. (punch hole - PH)</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">There were other methods used less frequently (rivet in the upper left corner comes to mind) but you don't see too many of them.&nbsp;
The practice continues to this day with CDs. Most of the time the CD case and inside paperwork is cut through with a saw or a hole is cut through the UPC symbol.</font></p>


<p align="Left"><font face="Arial">On some rare occasions a record manufacturer would mark a jacket with a cutout type mark when a record was given away as a promotional item.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Capital Records did that in the 1970s/80s by punching a large (&gt; 1/2") hole in the cover, usually in the upper right corner.&nbsp; Others used the cut corner (CC) tactic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the majority of the time you run into a cutout it was as a result of an overstock sale.</font></p>
