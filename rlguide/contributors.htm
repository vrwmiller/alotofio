      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>LABEL IMAGES 
          NEEDED:</b> The task of identifying what label variations appear on 
          what LP can be determined by examining many examples of record labels. 
          What we are attempting to do is get images of EVERY release on a particular 
          label. By doing this, we can identify the last release of a particular 
          variation. This method is not 100% fool proof but it will be accurate 
          the majority of the time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Do you have images 
          of record labels you can contribute? We will accept ANY images that 
          you have. It doesn't matter if we already have it, we are always looking 
          for more examples/variations. And not just of the labels that we are 
          currently researching. We are building a database of images of ANY label 
          that will be used for future editions of the Label Guide.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Now on to that offer 
          of 'Free Advertising Space' or discounts off the list price of the finished 
          guide. If you are a dealer and can send at least a hundred usable images, 
          we can offer business card sized ads - for free. If you have hundreds 
          of images we will make it a quarter page (of an 8.5x11 page) display 
          ad - for free. And the dealer who contributes the largest number of 
          usable images will receive a full page ad - for free.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">As for a discount 
          off the purchase price, anyone who contributes an image will be listed 
          on the Credits page. Percentages of 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 are offered 
          off of the list price of the final printed book for individuals who 
          contribute usable images. The amount of the discount will be based on 
          the number of images submitted and how usable they are to us. See the 
          <a href="images.htm">Images</a> page for more information.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INFORMATION NEEDED</b>: 
          Did you work for a record label or in any of the pressing plants? Do 
          you have more in-depth knowledge about different pressings than the 
          average person? If you share that knowledge with us and can substantiate 
          it, you will receive at least a mention on the Credits page. Anyone 
          who provides more detailed information will earn the same percentages 
          off the list price as an image contributor will earn.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This project cannot 
          be successfully completed without the assistance of all record collectors. 
          Please drop us an <a href="mailto:rlguide@recordranch.com">email</a> 
          and let us know what you have to offer. We can accept information via 
          email, on disks through the USPS, or by ftp directly to our server.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">From time to time we will be posting requests for specific images. 
          Most of these requests will be for copies of label variations that we 
          do not have and are looking for high quality images that will be included 
          in the final book. To see a list of the current needed images, click
